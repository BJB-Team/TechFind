## About the Project

### **Built With (Tech Stack)**

The core programming languages used to build this application are:

- Ruby on Rails [Read Docs](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)
- HTML5 [Read Docs (Not official)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
- CSS3 [Read Docs (Not official)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
- JavaScript (ES6) [Read Docs](https://262.ecma-international.org/6.0/)
- ReactJS [Read Docs](https://reactjs.org/)
- Postgresql 13.3 [Read Docs](https://www.postgresql.org/)

### **Statement of Purpose**

The purpose of the TechFind application is to link IT positions with candidates with those skills. Say goodbye to Junior Dev roles seeking 10 years experience in .NET roles. Each Job Poster can assign themselves to a company and create job advertisements to seek out potential employees.

### **Wireframes**

Here are the initial wireframes for the TechFind application.

### **Target Audience**

The target audience for this application are people in the technology industry looking for a job board that is specific to their industry.

### **Project Management**

To manage the team for this application a Trello board was set up.

### **Functionality**

### **User Stories**

Here are some User Stories that we built this application from.

#### As a Seeker

> “As a job seeker, I want to see what jobs candidates are posting, so that I can advance my career.”
> "As a job seeker, I can login with my email and a password, so that I have a unique identification."
> "As a job seeker, I can add some details like email, mobile or location, so that future employers can get in contact with me."
> "As a job seeker, I can search by job categories, so that I can find jobs specific to my ideal career."
> "As a job seeker, I can update and change my profile details, so that as my circumstances change I can stay up to date."
> "As a job seeker, I can upload my resume/CV, so that potential employers can download it at any point in time."
> "As a job seeker, I can message a job poster through the application, so that I can get a quick response back directly from the person/company."

#### As a Poster

> “As a job poster, I want to find the right candidates, so that I get the best people for the job.”
> "As a job poster, I can login with my email and password, so that I have a unique identification."
> "As a job poster, I can login under my company profile, so that seekers can see which company I work for."
> "As a job poster, I can add jobs to my company profile, so that I can show future prospects what jobs I am hiring for."

### **Third Party Apps/Services**

Here are the third party applications used for TechFinder, in no particular order:

- [Knock](https://github.com/nsarno/knock): A Ruby gem for creating user authentication. A quick alternative to creating authentication from scratch.
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/): This is a cloud platform that lets the user build, deliver, monitor and scale applications. This means a user can host their full stack application on the internet for free. But for this application Heroku will take care of the backend.
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/): This platform allows users to host their front end projects on the cloud for free with a 'freemium' plan. This platform will hold our React frontend as it requires less building than trying to deploy with Heroku.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/): An online platform for users to store public and private coding projects for free. This platform pairs with Heroku and Netlify. Github stores the code and Heroku provides the server to fetch the code and send it to the browser. It is also the platform that allow the team to store the code in a single repository and keeps track of all the git commits and merging.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/): Version control software that is free. It helps the user keep track of changes allowing them to branch and rollback revisions.
- [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/): Bootstrap makes putting HTML and CSS together on the web browser simple. By streamlining the code required visually appealing layouts can be
- [Figma](https://figma.com/): This program allows users with little amount of graphic design skills to make mock versions of websites, business cards and other mock ups.
- [Trello](https://trello.com/): This is a project management tool used to keep track of features and items that need to be done. Our Trello board can be viewed [here](https://trello.com/b/U2Pme2ea/project-management).
- [Git Guardian](https://www.gitguardian.com/): This program scans the users GitHub account to ensure any passwords or keys aren't made public for someone to scrape and use for malicious activities.
- [DB Diagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/home): A online platform used to give a visual display of the Entity Relationship Diagram for the back end on Find-A-Planner.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): The most popular code editing software with plenty of extensions to help code this application. VS Code is owned by Microsoft and is free to use.
