## About the Project

### **Built With (Tech Stack)**

The core programming languages used to build this application are:

- Ruby (3.0.1) on Rails (6.1.4) [Read Docs]()
- HTML5 [Read Docs]()
- CSS3 [Read Docs]()
- JavaScript (ES6) [Read Docs]()
- ReactJS [Read Docs]()
- Postgresql 13.3 [Read Docs]()

### **Statement of Purpose**

The purpose of the TechFind application is to link IT positions with candidates with those skills. Say goodbye to Junior Dev roles seeking 10 years experience in .NET.

### **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**

### **Third Party Apps/Services**

Here are the third party applications used for TechFinder, in no particular order:

- [Knock](https://github.com/nsarno/knock): A Ruby gem for creating user authentication. A quick alternative to creating authentication from scratch.
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/): This is a cloud platform that lets the user build, deliver, monitor and scale applications. This means a user can host their full stack application on the internet for free.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/): An online platform for users to store public and private coding projects for free. This platform pairs with Heroku. Github stores the code and Heroku provides the server to fetch the code and send it to the browser.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/): Version control software that is free. It helps the user keep track of changes allowing them to branch and rollback revisions.
- [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/): Bootstrap makes putting HTML and CSS together on the web browser simple. By streamlining the code required visually appealing layouts can be
- [Figma](https://figma.com/): This program allows users with little amount of graphic design skills to make mock versions of websites, business cards and other mock ups.
- [Trello](https://trello.com/) / [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira): This is a project management tool used to keep track of features and items that need to be done. My Trello board can be viewed [here](https://trello.com/b/UWs8TN6Q/marketplaceapp).
- [Git Guardian](https://www.gitguardian.com/): This program scans the users GitHub account to ensure any passwords or keys aren't made public for someone to scrape and use for malicious activities.
- [DB Diagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/home): A online platform used to give a visual display of the Entity Relationship Diagram for the back end on Find-A-Planner.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): The most popular code editing software with plenty of extensions to help code this application. VS Code is owned by Microsoft and is free to use.

## Roadmap

In the future I would like to add some automation to the site. Possibly give some standard advice. After I get the site fully functioning.
